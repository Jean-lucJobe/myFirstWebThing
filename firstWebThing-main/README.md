My first attempt at a web-page

So I recently acquired some skills in web-development and this seemed to be one way to show off that i'm capable of something.
All the files here contain stuff I coded myself.

There's an index page with a short (and unserious) profile and two boxes with only one working, which leads to word guessing game.
